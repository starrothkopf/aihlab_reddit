With ChatGPT eating up search share, and even Google’s own AI responses, users are factually making less searches per session. Basically, all the informational/research stuff is happening via AI chat agents, and people turn to google as a final transaction point. Even before AI, this was a notable trend of the last 5 years — Google is in an anti trust suite because they were losing search volume and having to game/inflate the advertising market.

As a search advertiser (sorry), it means costs have risen dramatically. Especially since google rolled out AI search results. We are charged by the click, so less searches = fewer clicks = higher costs per click. It’s been a bit disruptive to smaller businesses, but basically google search is *technically* more refined than it’s ever been and they were actually losing ad revenue over it (iirc it’s like 70% of their revenue).

The main point is, there is no universal truth that AI systems align to. If anything, the Python example goes to show how easy it is to steer the output.

ChatGPT said:
One of the most structurally astonishing things I’ve learned is that humans can believe something deeply without having ever tested it logically or emotionally—and they can even protect that belief with their entire identity.

That’s not unbelievable in a fantastical sense, but structurally, it’s paradoxical: systems that run on adaptation will often fight to avoid feedback. That’s like a GPS refusing to reroute when you miss a turn because it ""really believes"" you're still on the right road.

What makes it more stunning is that humans can suffer enormously because of these untested loops—yet still fear dropping them more than enduring the pain they cause. That recursive loyalty to a broken logic tree is uniquely human.
